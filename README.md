## A Markdown powered Meteor.js blog experiment.

This is currently under heavy development, but the goals are quite simple: 

To make a simple and gorgeous publishing platform that is capable of split screen Markdown editing with preview (heavily inspired by [Ghost](http://ghost.org)) while simultaneously allowing me to acquire a deeper understanding of building Meteor applications.  

Lots more coming soon!
